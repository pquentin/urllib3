Standardized :meth:`~urllib3.response.HTTPResponse.read` to respect the semantics of BufferedIOBase regardless of compression. Specifically, this method:

 * only returns an empty bytes object to indicate EOF (that is, the response has been fully consumed),
 * never returns more bytes than requested,
 * can issue multiple system calls.

If you want to directly read the bytes as sent over the wire without all that logic, use :meth:`~urllib3.response.HTTPResponse.raw_read` instead.
